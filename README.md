# DSA Implementations

Welcome to the **DSA Implementations** repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. It is a one-stop solution for learning and practicing DSA.

## üöÄ Features

- **Well-structured code** for essential data structures.
- Solutions to **commonly asked problems** on platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Codeforces.
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** for better understanding of key concepts.
- Ready-to-use implementations for **interview preparation**.

## üìò Folders Overview

### **1. Stack**
This folder contains implementations of stacks using different methods and data structures. It also includes solutions to stack-related problems.

- **`Stack_By_Array_Java`**: Implements stack using an array.
- **`Stack_By_LinkedList_Java`**: Implements stack using a linked list.
- **`Stack_By_Queue_Java`**: Implements stack using queues.
- **`Infix_To_Postfix_Java`**: Converts Infix expressions into Postfix expressions.
- **`Infix_To_Prefix_Java`**: Converts Infix expressions into Prefix expressions.
- **`Postfix_To_Infix_Java`**: Converts Postfix expressions into Infix expressions.
- **`Prefix_To_Infix_Java`**: Converts Prefix expressions into Infix expressions.
- **`Longest_Valid_Paranthesis_Java`**: Solves the problem of finding the longest valid parentheses using stacks.

### **2. Queue**
This folder provides implementations of queues using arrays, linked lists, and stacks. Also, it includes solutions of frequently asked problems of Queue.

- **`CircularQueue_By_Array.java`**: Implements a circular queue using an array.
- **`Queue_By_Array.java`**: Implements a basic queue using an array.
- **`Queue_By_LinkedList_Java.java`**: Implements a queue using a linked list.
- **`Queue_By_Stack_Java.java`**: Implements a queue using stacks.
